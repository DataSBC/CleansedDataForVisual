2,"I called about an item that was missing from my book order (that was almost $400). Nowhere on the form did it mention a back-ordered item or anything ... it just wasn't in the box, but was on the list. When I called to question it, I was told that it was out of stock. Only after asking what would happen next did the representative say that I would receive a credit on my account. Pushing further about not wanting the credit on my account since it was a parent credit card, I was then told that they would be credited the $13. Finally, I asked how they would know that the item was out of stock and that the would receive a refund ... I was told that it was my responsibility to communicate that to the parent.  So ... I was left wondering ... what would have happened had I not called about the missing item in the first place?",Shipping/Delivery,Item Missing/Damaged

2,"My school has been determined to be tax exempt, but for some reason, I'm being charged tax again. I have submitted a tax exempt form on Aug. 23rd, and have been told as of today, they still do not have my tax exempt status on file. I can not place any orders until this is resolved. Also, the new process to be reimbursed for tax is unreasonable.",Account Balance/Payment,Tax

3,"First, the Scholastic Online Purchasing Portal should be aligned with the individual Account upon sign-in and able to recognize a Tax Exempt Customer, or provide an option to indicate Tax Exempt Status so that upon Check-Out, Tax is automatically removed from the Sale. Which leads to my Second comment I must mention to improve the Overall Customer Experience. Upon completion of the transaction, while the Customer Service Email is readily accessible, I submitted my Request to Credit the Tax immediately following Check-Out, only to receive a reply from a Customer Service Representative asking me to RESUBMIT my request in 2 days TO REMIND THEM to Credit the Tax. If the Tax Exempt Credit cannot be incorporated into the initial online transaction, an internal reminder system would greatly improve the Customer Service Experience. While we do appreciate the Scholastic selections at a public school-friendly cost, the online protocol for Tax Exempt Customers is quite cumbersome, particularly at the beginning of the school year, to submit a Request for Credit of Tax Charged upon completion of the transaction, not only once, but especially twice. Thank you for your consideration.",Account Balance/Payment,Tax

I told her it used to be on the front corner, but now it is on the back. I told her when this happened in the past we were able to get a voucher for a free book with their next order.  She said they would have to cancel their orders and start again.  Lisa stated that if the parents did not request the free books, they probably didn't want them.  That is absurd.

It's not about the money, but I am appalled. Considering how patient teachers have been during the shortages, extreme wait times for orders last year, etc., you would think Scholastic would be bending over backwards to be kind to those who held on and were loyal to them.

I’m afraid October orders won’t get sent out in time for Halloween which has happened to us in the past. What can you do better? You can get catalogs out when you say you will.,Kits,Kits

But your company claims that that was an old Promotion and I already received it. If that is the case, then it should not be popping up on my screen.

2,The customer service agent was polite and informative. However the problem was the one of the books one of my students ordered was in back order (according to customer service rep). However that detail was not listed on my Oder receipt in the delivery box. So I looked and looked for the book. And then there was no apology note to the parent about the book delay so I had to create that. And no replacement book while student waits for book on back order. Scholastic used to indicate which books were on back order and include a note and extra book for  patient customer while they wait for other book to arrive. At least customer service agent on the phone should have offered me (or customer) future discount or something.,Product Variety/Inventory,Out of Stock

2,"My concern was that as I wanted to order for my grandchildren and saw on the home page that I could have free shipping with a $25 order. For the last two and a half years, I had quite a few deliveries to my home without issue. However, when I went to the order page, it was no longer an option (according to the chat rep.) When I asked why, the rep. answered that the warehouse was overwhelmed and it wasn't profitable for Scholastic to continue. I can understand that, but if it is listed on the home page as an option under the words ""Welcome back--We heard you"", then the option should have been removed from that site. I felt misled to believe it was still an option until I got to the order page and found out otherwise. I am a grandparent of six school-age children and would like to support all of them, but am not always able to spend $25 on each one, nor can I find the quality of books that Scholastic has had in the past. As a teacher I also used Scholastic for many, many years, but I will probably not order again unless I can have books delivered to my home. I wouldn't mind paying a nominal fee if necessary, but to suddenly have the ship-to-home option removed without notice is not what I expected from Scholastic.",Shipping/Delivery,Ship to Home
