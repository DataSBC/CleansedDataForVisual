10/12/22 3:10 PM,2,"First, the customer service representative was very professional. My issue is with the message I was given after I inquired as to why parents can place online orders less than $25 and not be charged a shipping fee, but orders less than $25 from the school and mailed by the teacher are assessed a $6.50. If I continue to use Scholastic, I suppose I will let parents know that online orders are their only option. This policy, however, seems unfair to schools/teachers with students who have do not have home internet service and is certainly unfair to teachers to expect them to pay the shipping costs or figure out the logistics of who owes what when orders come in from home that happen to total less than $25.",Shipping/Delivery,Shipping Fee

Please consider making this a possibility.  I'm sure that you know that a great many teachers WAY over spend the $250 allotment we can claim on our taxes.

10/10/22 4:10 PM,1,"If scholastic is taking orders online on my behalf, then the scholastic, ordering process simply must include the child’s first and last names. I received an order of books with three orders, only having the child’s first name. The children don’t know what their parents have ordered, because they are simply too young. I am the librarian, not their classroom teacher, so reaching out to every parent, who could possibly have a child with that first name makes me look like an idiot. This makes me not want to place, scholastic orders in the future. Your ordering process needs to be corrected. When I called in and spoke with customer service, the person I spoke to, on the telephone, was dismissive, and could not understand what I was talking about, and was of absolutely no help. Then I escalated trying to email, at which point I still had to go back and forth with many emails before I was able to get the child’s first name and last name of the parent ordering. You have this Information because you took the orders and collected the payment. Therefore, it is your responsibility to share that information with the person who is supposed to be handing the books out. This is the most frustratingly simple concept, that I am absolutely astounded, it required so much effort on my part to get scholastic to understand, and then eventually help me with.",Customer Service,CS Experience

I am a Golden Apple 30-year customer and am used to better customer service from Scholastic. The person on the phone was not able to help me and spent a lot of time telling me why they couldn't resend my order or otherwise help me the way they used to. I understood her point but ultimately it did not provide me with the assistance I needed or expected as a long time customer.

10/7/22 10:57 AM,2,"The basic problem is that a special order (free items not included with my classroom Sept. order)   #300108054, # 300110204, and #300112405 were all delivered to the WRONG ADDRESS.  They were shipped to 3616 Yale Dr. Longmont, CO 80503 instead of the preschool address at 1177 Princeton Dr. Longmont, CO 80503.  I called three separate times about this issue and was told that the only address listed is the correct one - 1177 Princeton Dr. Longmont, CO 80503.  Another shipment was sent out twice and yet they were also delivered to 3616 Yale Dr. Longmont, CO  (the WRONG ADDRESS).  Customer service could not explain what is happening and I was told I would receive an email clarifying the issue so that this does not happen again.  Please look into this further and communicate to me why this happened three times and confirm that this issue has been resolved. Thank you!",Possible Tech Issue/TRF,Teacher/Class Info Issue
