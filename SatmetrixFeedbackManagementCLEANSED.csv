Would it be possible to overnight this 200.00 order to make the parents in my class happy.  Please advise.,Shipping/Delivery,Delayed/Never Received Order

3,The email was extremely helpful and she stated the book box with order forms was send to the address 3918 FM 2405 Winters Texas 79567.  I did receive an email that the book box was delivered to 500 North Heights.  I used to be the director at the 500 north heights address. They do not want any book orders sent to them or when they saw my name they threw it in the trash.  I currently watch babies in the home. The parents are eager to get books for their children. I will submit an online order but want to make sure it has the 3918 FM address I appreciate your assistance. I taught school for 33 years and was director of the Winters cdc for over 10 years. I have slot of bonus points I plan to use soon to purchase things for.the babies parents and their older siblings. Thank you. Cheryl Sneed,Shipping/Delivery,Delayed/Never Received Order

1,I am a teacher. I use a state issued funds card for purchases. The state requires us to make tax free purchases. Scholastic customer service said I could make a purchase then call to get a refund if I was eligible for tax free. Refunds get complicated and tie up funds I could be using for other purchases. It would be nice to submit tax documentation before a purchase was made.,Account Balance/Payment,Tax

In this day and age, an order should be able to be cancelled or another item added an order so that customers don't pay a ridiculous amount of shipping for their students.

1,I submitted my order on Sept. 30th. When I checked later it was still in my cart.  So then I lost points and promotions because Oct. was not as good as Sept. I didn't even receive Sept flyers to send out to my parents  so that is why I was trying to put in the oct. early.  I have received the oct. flyers three times though.  I was told that since I didn't save the email with the confirmation when I ordered I lose out and basically can't do anything to help me. Issues I had last year are the reason I didn't submit orders each month like I used to.  I got tired of telling parents that the order had been delayed. I am hoping these problems don't continue and get put back that I was in the wrong or I won't be doing scholastic orders in the future.,Shipping/Delivery,Delayed/Never Received Order

I asked again and was told the same thing--I just wanted to know why it wasn't stated on my account and where did it come from.  I had an online credit for quite awhile so if this recent order was able to have part of that amount credited to my account, why wasn't the $1.05 deducted from my online credit (a rep said it was from a 9/30 order, but I only used points for that order).  It's such a small amount so I just decided to let it go and just pay it with my next order.  It's frustrating to be told I have an outstanding balance and not know where or why it's there.

I have to reorder the books and spend an additional $25 to order the correct books and to use the special deal of the month.

1,"It was extraordinarily difficult to create and then locate the eWallets.  I have two kids so I had to create two.  I eventually figured out how to do it, but it was nearly impossible to view the created eWallet so I inadvertently created many duplicates.  Please update the page navigation to include a separate link to view eWallets (currently there is only a link to create one).  Please also create functionality to merge duplicates or delete empty ones.   When I first contacted customer service at 7:45am they told me they were completely unable to assist because they did not work on the Book Fair side.  I reached back out after 8am and was able to find someone who gave me a direct link.  Both customer service reps were polite, but neither were able to resolve the issue.  The whole experience was very very frustrating.",Customer Service,CS Experience

3,"The representative got back to me in a timely manner.  Apparently I owe $0.05 from an order from last year (I'm assuming it was a student order).  I was hoping it could  be deleted since it was a student order and I do not want to write a check for 5 cents.  I don't mind having an extra 5 cents charged to my next teacher order if I can figure out how to do that.  Last year I had two inquiries that I never got resolved regarding 1.  A student's order.  I still don't know if the student was charged for a book she never received or not; and 2.  a parent told me she never received a free book.  I sent an email asking about it and never got a reply. I love the deals from Scholastic.  I have been able to add a lot of books to my classroom library.  I'm disappointed in the shipping fee for orders under $25.  It actually doesn't affect me too much because I can't help myself - I order books every month.  But, last year it occurred to me that it is not fair to teachers.  There was one order that I only got a $5.00 order until the last day before the due date.  If the second person hadn't ordered, I would have had to pay $25 or cancel the order all together.  I had a couple of unresolved issues last year that I already mentioned on a different question.  BUT, OVERALL, I LOVE SCHOLASTIC!!",Shipping/Delivery,Shipping Fee

I just need the name to be switched for mailing purposes and when I receive emails from scholastic. I asked to have this problem resolved last year. I'm asking again as it hasn't been. It would be nice if I weren't asked to let my staff know that there will continue to be a different name on my packages instead of just apologizing for the mix up. It seems like a year is more than enough time to resolve things on your end.",Customer Service,CS Experience

My question was why arent those codes sent on the first of the month in order to allow all orders entered (whether the 1st or 31st) to have the code to use.  Yes, I got my points but it was a hassle to have to contact you in order to do it.",All Other,All Other
