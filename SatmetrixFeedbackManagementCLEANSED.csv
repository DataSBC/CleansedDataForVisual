One of my students did not receive a book, nothing on the packing slip or the individual name list, told me a book was missing! I should not have to go back to my original order and check to see if each book I ordered was sent in the package. There should be a list of backordered/missing books so we can let students know.

1,"Teachers are already expected to spend too much money out of pocket on our classrooms, the fact that Scholastic is asking us to spend another $6.50 of our OWN money for shipping each month is ridiculous. I get it, you're priority is getting items here fast since shipping has been a complete mess since Covid, but now you're going to lose business. We can't guarantee that we will get even ONE order from students, especially in low income areas such as mine. And they said that if one student orders online the class won't have to pay shipping, well is that because the parent of that child has already paid it?! Come on, Scholastic. Go back to what it used to be like. I am not willing to continue with book orders now that you're requiring this.",Shipping/Delivery,Shipping Fee

4,Website that allows for system override from customer service (dollar book site has glitches for customers who qualified but missed the tab when ordering). The dollar site seems to be intentionally difficult to access for teachers with qualifying orders. A way for your company to save money??? I have be a customer for 19 years and in recent years I feel less satisfied with products and services. You should value teachers and our wishes or unfortunately we will stop ordering (even if that means providing less books for students) as we spend so much of our own money to pay for classroom books.,Price,Price

1,"I recently moved to Texas from Alabama and had a baby so I took this school year off. I was ordering books for my classroom next year using my points and selected to have them sent to my home address. I am 100% sure that I did that and actually attempted to put my account as homeschool to have my previous school removed. When I submitted my order it said my account had to be verified and when they did that, it defaulted to my old school instead of my new home address and so they sent it to my old school in Alabama. I immediately messaged you and said it was sent to the wrong address. The first person was very nice and said they would get it fixed and sent to my home address and to just send them the address. The next 4 different people that responded to me after that basically told me I was out of luck because I can’t use my teacher account or my points that I earned because I’m not a full time teacher and that it was too late to cancel the order or change it and that it would be sent to Alabama and that I need to pay to have my school send it to me. So I payed $7 in shipping for it to be sent 700 miles away from me and will have to pay to have it shipped from the school as well. I have been told multiple times that I didn’t select the right shipping but I am 100% sure that I typed my Texas address in and selected home address because I did not plan to drive 700 miles to pick up 5 books. I did not appreciate that I was told it could be fixed until I said I wasn’t teaching and then all of a sudden it couldn’t be fixed. Also it is very confusing to have so many different people sending different responses. This whole experience was very frustrating.",Customer Service Interaction,CS Experience
