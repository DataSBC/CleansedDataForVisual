4,There was no warning or disclaimer that if I did not create an account first the site may timeout and erase my cart. My cart was erased and I had to begin again. I couldn't bother to find all the same books again so I ended up ordering less. As a busy parent the more convenient the shopping experience the better. Thank you for the great selections and good prices.,Possible Tech Issue/TRF,Adding Items to Cart

2,UPS tried delivering my package last Saturday.  Schools are closed on Saturdays.  Then they attempted to deliver a second time yesterday at 6:30pm-my school keeps business hours which are Monday-Friday from 7:30am-4:30pm.  I asked the Scholastic representative if he could help me add a note to the delivery to tell UPS about our business hours and he said that wasn't possible.  I tried calling UPS and the automated system doesn't allow me to speak to a representative and the live chat is also not allowing me to chat with someone.  I am very frustrated as my students have been excitedly waiting for their books.  Please help.,Customer Service,CS Experience

2,"I experienced a great deal of frustration today! I have been waiting almost a month to receive my entire order. My students are asking about their books. The last time I checked, it said the book were on their way. Now I see nothing about the order nor have I seen the books that were not included in the first delivery.    Last year I heard that Scholastic was a big mess and teachers were frustrated. Therefore, I did not send out book orders. I was hopeful that things would be improved this year but my first order has not gone well. I am not sure that I will continue with Scholastic.     I believe Scholastic was a great company, even when I was a student, but the frustration is not one that I choose to give to myself. I hope that whatever is happening within the company can be fixed.    Thank you for listening.",Shipping/Delivery,Delayed/Never Received Order

4,I visited the site today to order flyers for my students.  I was taken off the automatic mailing list last year because I didn't order for three months.  I didn't order because this was when Scholastic was experiencing some troubles and it took months to get my original order.  I have placed several orders since and called to be placed back on the automatic mailing list several times.  I still have to log in and request catalogs each month.  The frustrating part is that I know of another teacher in my school that hasn't ordered in over a year and still gets an automatic catalog each month.,Kits,Kits

5,"My experience with your site was completely satisfactory. My son brought home a paper copy of the Scholastic TAB catalog from school, and he read through it and found a book that he wanted. I then went to the URL listed in the catalog and entered the class code that his teacher had written in the appropriate space on the catalog. That called up my son's school and teacher's name. I then checked the catalog and found the item # for the book that he wanted, and when I entered the #, the appropriate book was added to the shopping cart. I then proceeded to checkout and paid and got a confirmation number. All the steps in this process were intuitive, easy to understand, and easy to accomplish. In these crazy and uncertain times that we live in, it was very satisfying to have such a smooth experience. Thank you for that.",Thanks/Praise,Thanks/Praise

1,How are age appropriate books determined?  On one of my 5th graders flyers there was a book about a summer romance between two boys.  This is not appropriate for children of this age.  As  someone who grew up with Scholastic Books I am thoroughly disappointed that  it has shifted from a book seller dedicated to develop the love of reading in children to providing inappropriate materials.  I'll be speaking to our school administrators as well as district about this content.,Product Variety/Inventory,Divisive Content
