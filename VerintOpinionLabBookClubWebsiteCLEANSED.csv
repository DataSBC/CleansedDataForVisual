2,I ordered A LOT of books in September and received NO new flyers to give out.  I used to get a set of flyers in each box of books but no longer receive any.  I was going to send home book flyer this Friday but I have none to give out.  This new system needs to change if you want us to order books.  Kids need to get their own flyers and they love it.,Kits,Kits

We saw there were sets available, but found it difficult to know which actual books from the series (in numeral order) were in the set. The titles may have been available, but it's much easier for me to know the number off the top of my head. Also would like the search to be improved to where you can search for an author and view ALL titles available by that author. We had the same challenge trying to find out which ""The Bad Guys"" books were available even when searching ""Aaron Blabey.""",Product Variety/Inventory,Product Info/Description

4,"Last year it took a few google searches to figure out the difference between ""book fair"" and ""book club"".  ""Book club"" sounded like a subscription and ""book fair"" sounded like the thing we do when our children bring home a flyer.  The notes at the top and bottom of the flyer were really helpful for finding the right website.  I assume ""book fair"" is for the times when scholastic shows up onsite, and yet an online ordering option exists then, too.  I like both options because the take-home flyer results in many more ordered books and the on-site book fair gives kids an opportunity to practice working with cash.  I am also pleased with Scholastic's prices, and I love taking advantage of the free-book-with order deal.  I end up ordering more than I would have each time my child brings home a flyer.  The absolute best part of Scholastic is the free books given to kids and schools as part of the fund-raising process.  Our school needs more books in Spanish for their library.",LOB Confusion,General/Unspecified

1,I had a $300 order....I submitted the one order that was done online.  I am refunding the parents money on the flyer orders.  I will no longer be using Scholastic.  The personal touch is gone.  Parents write checks.  If a book is out then you don't take a back order and send it when it comes in and compensate the child with a free book pick.  I instead am supposed to get the parents to cut a new check or pick out a different book.  I don't have time for all that nonsense. At one time this company was a delight  with which to work.

I know there is a massive push to have equality and inclusiveness in so many books which can be noble but it seems to be at the expense of quality. So much of the selection feels like it's trying too hard to push a narrative and I'm struggling to find books that are awesome. There are still some of the classics available but it feels like they are more hard to find and so many of the newer offerings are either too politically charged or just plain ""meh.""",Product Variety/Inventory,Divisive Content

4,I think there should be an easier way to choose books when you have something like $10 worth of books as a bonus. I tried to choose ahead of time but the books weren't available for the free choice. Then I had to go to the long list and scroll while looking at price and title but it's cumbersome to have to keep clicking on each book to see the description. I'm not sure how to make it easier but that's the only part of ordering that frustrates me.   I also forgot to enter my apple bonus points but customer service fixed that for me.  Thanks!,Product Variety/Inventory,Product Info/Description

4,"Site reminds me of websites maybe 10 years ago, not the smoothest e-commerce website in the world.  At one point I entered an item number from my child's flyer in the search bar but a different book came up. Also, I clicked on a category, ""Feelings and emotions"" and did not see an item  that clearly should have been in that category (the ""Big Feelings Pack).  The way the items were displayed seemed clumsy and I had to click through multiple pages of items to review. I guess I'm comparing you guys to Amazon, where I do a lot of online shopping, and obviously they have a very slick site with all the bells and whistles. Ultimately I was able to find the books I was looking for there was a specific ""enter the item number"" box that did work correctly. Other than that, my experience was fine. I love Scholastic, wish you much succcess!",Possible Tech Issue/TRF,Search Function/Discrepancy Flyer vs Website Info

4,I am so surprised at the limited rewards for teachers when placing Scholastic orders. I have encouraged families to purchase books this month and have an order of over $300. This only allowed me to earn $10 to spend right now and the 5 free books for over $25. This doesn't really incentivize teachers to use Scholastic over another company/amazon.,Bonus Points/Rewards/Promos,General/Unspecified

5,I've been using Scholastic book clubs and pushing my classroom families to make purchases for 8 year. In those 8 years the only disappointment has been the dissolution of physical catalogs. I work in a low income school where many parents do not feel comfortable using the online ordering platform. I also use the catalogs as an incentive for students to get excited about the books they see (1st grade) and and can remind their parents to send in cash for their book order. I wish I didn't have to continually order physical catalogs each month.,Kits,Kits

Would have been nice to receive some compensation for the long delay in shipping the orders.,All Other,Hopeful Shipping Improves this Year

3,Sometimes the site is difficult to navigate. I wanted to place a book order for my son and also add money to my daughter's ewallet for her upcoming fair. I had to switch back and forth between multiple pages to find out how to do that and I am pretty tech savvy. I can't imagine those who are not as confident with technology having success with it.,LOB Confusion,E-Wallet

At least, if a book isn't rated on a given system, an N/A would be nice to you aren't in doubt.    I wish every book had a preview that included example text.  I'm trying to select books that are at the appropriate reading level, and without an example of the text, you're really flying blind.
