All I had to do was provide my email and the representative pulled up my orders and could see everything that I had submitted within seconds.

10/17/2022,2,Why should I have to pay shipping for a parent order? Parents RARELY want to buy from Scholastic any more. Adding shipping cost and making the teacher pay it makes me not want to send home flyers. It is a task to pull them apart and write the code on the flyers for ONE single parent to want to even order. Shipping cost should not also be put on the teacher. This is very discouraging.,Shipping/Delivery,Shipping Fee

There is still no way to find out the status of my order that was placed by the school.  I can find the school and the teacher (must be the one person that handles all the orders for the school) but still there is no status of an order.  There is no order shown.  The order was turned into the school on 9/28/22 which was the deadline.   I now have the October order forms and actually thought about placing another order but wanted to make sure I wasnâ€™t ordering the same book but I canâ€™t find my first order.  Need this info or I will not place another order.  Would like to also know when the books will be delivered.

I have used Scholastic book clubs since I began teaching 28 years ago, and I am really sad to discontinue , but prices have increased so drastically that less and less parents order. The $25 minimum order to receive free shipping is a killer also. There is a coupon code listed on the teacher desk page which states only that bonus points are received for submitting an order by October 31. There is nothing said about it being a $25 minimum order, but it would not allow me to use the coupon until my order reached $25. With few parents ordering, I am not willing to either eat the shipping cost or come up with $20 of my own purchases in order to make the minimum.",Price,Price
